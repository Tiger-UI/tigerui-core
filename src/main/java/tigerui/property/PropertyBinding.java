/**
 * A Property Binding is a special type of Property Observer that represents an
 * observer that binds one property to another. When dispatching events property
 * bindings are processed first, this guarantees that all properties have the up
 * to date value instantly at the same time before any other observers receive
 * updates. The reasoning behind this is that it should help to remove glitches
 * and redundant updates. See
 * <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25141234">glich description</a>.

 * @param <M>
 *            the type of data observed by this observer.
