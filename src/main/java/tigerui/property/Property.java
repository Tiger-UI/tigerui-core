/**
 * A Property is some value that can change over time. It is similar to a
 * {@link Subject} with the exception that the onNext method has been called
 * onChanged and there is no onError or onCompleted methods. To 'complete' the
 * property it is necessary to call {@link #dispose()}.<br>
 * <br>
 * A property is intended to be used as a replacement for traditional mutable
 * fields and listeners. The canonical use case would be as a field in some
 * model.<br>
 * <br>
 * For a property to be well behaved it must guarantee the following contract:
 * <br>
 * 1) only emit a values if the new value differs than the previous<br>
 * 2) always offer a non-null value from the method {@link #get()}<br>
 * 3) always emit a value when subscribed to. If the property is already
 * disposed when subscribed to the subscriber will receive the last value and
 * then be unsubscribed<br>
 * 4) never accept a new value while it is currently dispatching a value.
 * Re-entrancy is strictly blocked<br>
 * 5) cleanup all subscriptions after being destroyed<br>
 * 6) not leak any subscriptions after being destroyed<br>
 * <br>
 * ADDITIONAL NOTES:<br>
 * 1) Attempting to set the current value to null, will result in a
 * {@link NullPointerException}.<br>
 * 2) If your property can be null at any point, make sure to create an optional
 * property, using {@link #createOptional()} or {@link #createOptional(Object)}
 * <br>
 * 3) A property is not thread safe, therefore it can only be accessed from the
 * same thread that it was created on. Attempting to access any of a properties
 * methods a from a thread other than the one it was created on will result in
 * an {@link IllegalStateException}.<br>
 * 
 * 
 * @param <M>
 *            the type of object that this property emits.
